# methodsOntology
Repository for development of the neuroscience methods ontology.

## Files
### source-materials/
Source files that are inputs for generating the ttl files.

### src/
The code that generates the ttl.

### ttl/
#### ALERT ACHTUNG ATTENTION
_Identifiers contained herein are currently TEMPORARY
PLEASE do not let them into the wild!_

Ontology outputs to be loaded into scigraph.
nsupper.ttl holds an absurdly lightweight upper ontology
nsmethods.ttl will hold the methods concepts
nsbeing.ttl will hold entities that are subjects/specimines or tools/reagents
nsdatatypes.ttl will hold datatypes that are the outputs of methods

#### Editing ttl files
In order to keep diffs between edits to a minimum please use the version of protege found
[here](https://github.com/ignazio1977/protegetests/blob/master/protege-distribution-5.0.0-beta-18-SNAPSHOT-platform-independent.zip).
It uses OWLAPIv4 which produces deterministic ttl files.

### scigraph/
Scigraph configuration yaml files. To build scigraph and load the correct ontologies do the following.
Be sure to replace `git/` with the path where you have cloned the repos.
```
cd git/SciGraph/SciGraph-core
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="edu.sdsc.scigraph.owlapi.loader.BatchOwlLoader" -Dexec.args="-c git/methodsOntology/scigraph/methodsGraph.yaml"
cd git/SciGraph/SciGraph-services
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="edu.sdsc.scigraph.services.MainApplication" -Dexec.args="server git/methodsOntology/scigraph/methodsServices.yaml"
```

## Basic design principles
The objective of this ontology is to provide a lightweight framework for annotating
scientific protocols. To that end our initial approach is to separate the entities
and the data that are the inputs and outputs of protocols, from the higher level
methods concepts that describe those protocols.

The basic structure for each obo file will be a single parrent is_a hierarchy.
Other limited modeling may be added later as needed in order to serve other systems
that will directly represent protocols themselves.

### Identifier naming conventions
To make it easy to distinguish between curated and uncurated terms in raw ttl
we will _by convention_ (as in, do not rely on this for code because it will
not be enforced systematically) use the following:
```
UNCURATED:1234567
NOTINANONTOLOGY:1234567
CURATED:fragprefix_1234567
```
Curie mappings: UH OH

## Synonyms
Within the annotation ontology synonyms will simply be text strings that are
pulled from another more robust ontology (or other source) that is intended to
provide full support for the large diversity of types of synonyms as needed by
various users. Synonyms can also be entered directly as strings and we will
maintain a list of those synonyms that are missing definitions or require more
extensive curation and scholarship.

This will enable us to create a sane workflow that can quickly address practical
issues with production performance for scigraph annotations while also supporting
the needs of scholarship and textmining.
